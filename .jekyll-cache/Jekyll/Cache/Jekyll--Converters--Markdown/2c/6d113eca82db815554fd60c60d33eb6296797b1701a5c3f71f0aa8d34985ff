I"Ê<p>Working on optimizing my workflow with the rest of the team, I wanted to build
a little tool to fetch all the PRs that somebody has explicitly asked for my
review on. I did a little research, and played with the GitHub API, but didnâ€™t
find anything. I sent a quick message to their support, which was responded to
almost immediately. The trick was to use the generic â€˜Searchâ€™ query, instead of looking for a specifically built graphql sequence.</p>
